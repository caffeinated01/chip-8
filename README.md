# ðŸ‘¾ CHIP-8 Emulator

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker on his 1802 microprocessor ([Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)). This project is a CHIP-8 emulator written in C. I wrote it with the goal of dipping my feet into C while building something fun.\
